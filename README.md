## Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. It uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of movie attributes.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecommendation.git
    cd movierecommendation
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the environment variables** (if any):
    - Create a `.env` file and add your environment variables as required.

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**:
    ```sh
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```

2. **Train the model**:
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. **Access the application**:
    - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:
- [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/): Contains movie ratings and metadata.
- Additional datasets can be added as needed.

## Model

The recommendation system employs various machine learning models and algorithms:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes matrix factorization and nearest neighbors.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie metadata such as genres, actors, and directors.
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combines collaborative and content-based techniques for improved recommendations.

## Results

The recommendation system has been evaluated using standard metrics:
- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the recommendations.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability of the system to suggest relevant movies.
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error for rating predictions.
